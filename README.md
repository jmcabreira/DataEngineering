# 🧠 Data Engineering Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments focused on **Data Engineering**, with an emphasis on modern data modeling, transformation, and versioning techniques.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 1. `cumulative-data-modeling/`
Projects and notebooks related to **cumulative data modeling**, often used to track metrics over time (such as balances, running totals, continuous counts, etc.). Topics covered:
- Incremental modeling with SQL
- Query optimization for cumulative metrics
- Partitioning and ordering strategies

### 2. `slowly-changing-dimensions/`
Implementations of different types of **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**:
- SCD Types 1, 2, and 3 with practical examples
- Trade-offs between each type
- SQL scripts for platforms like BigQuery, Snowflake, and Redshift

### 3. `...`
 Next subjetct

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- SQL (**BigQuery** Standard SQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Python (pandas, dbt, etc.)
- ETL/ELT tools
- Git/GitHub for version control
- Docker
- Postgrees
  

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as a **learning lab and reference** for best practices in data engineering, helpful for both personal study and real-world data projects.
